# TidyTask Production Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap to production for TidyTask, with a target completion date of **May 12, 2025**.

## Overview

TidyTask is a family task management application that allows families to organize, assign, and track tasks among family members. The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration purposes. This roadmap outlines the steps required to replace mock data with real data from Supabase and make the application production-ready.

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| May 6 | Finalize API service implementation |
| May 7 | Implement data migration and Supabase integration |
| May 8 | Complete authentication flow and user management |
| May 9 | Implement real-time updates and notifications |
| May 10 | Conduct testing and bug fixes |
| May 11 | Optimize performance and finalize UI |
| May 12 | Deploy to production |

## Current Status

As of May 7, 2025, we have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the roadmap. The team has successfully:

1. Implemented Supabase authentication with email/password
2. Created a new AuthProvider context for managing authentication state
3. Updated the existing auth page to handle sign-in and sign-up processes
4. Created a Supabase client to handle database interactions
5. Defined database types based on the Supabase schema
6. Fixed TypeScript errors and implemented robust error handling

We are now moving into Phase 3, focusing on completing the profile management and family invitation system.

  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Input validation
  - [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor initial user activity
- [ ] Prepare for post-launch support

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements

Items that won't be included in the initial production release but should be addressed in future updates:

1. **Mobile Application**: Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement detailed usage analytics and reporting
3. **Calendar Integration**: Add integration with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.
4. **AI Task Suggestions**: Implement AI-powered task suggestions and automation
5. **Extended Family Support**: Support for extended family members and guests

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Authentication issues | High | Medium | Thorough testing of auth flows, fallback mechanisms |
| Data migration errors | High | Medium | Create backup systems, validation checks |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Low | Performance testing, lazy loading |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Low | Cross-browser testing, progressive enhancement |
| Supabase service disruption | High | Low | Implement offline mode, caching strategies |

## Success Criteria

The production release will be considered successful if:

1. Users can create accounts and set up family profiles
2. Tasks can be created, assigned, and managed in real-time
3. Family members can be added and managed with appropriate permissions
4. The application performs well on various devices and browsers
5. Core functionality works without any critical bugs

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to bringing TidyTask to production by May 12, 2025. By following this plan, we will systematically replace mock data with real data from Supabase and implement all necessary features for a production-ready application.

Regular progress reviews will be conducted to ensure we stay on track and address any challenges that arise during implementation.
